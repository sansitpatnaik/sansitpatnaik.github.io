[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"August 2017 - Present\nProject Supervisor: Prof. Avinash Kumar Agarwal\nOur project aims to convert a Gasoline based 4-Stroke SI engine to an M85 (85% v/v methanol and 15% v/v gasoline) based SI engine and develop an M85 fueled motorcycle prototype. Methanol as a fuel, provides higher Octane number, lower Hydrocarbon and NOx emissions leading to a cleaner environment and higher fuel efficiency than petroleum-based gasoline making it a significantly environment-friendly fuel.\nMethanol is a single component fuel produced from low-value biomass, MSW and high ash coal. The engine needs significant adaption, hardware modifications, and ECU calibration to operate on this new fuel. The first vehicle prototype in India, working on methanol-based fuel is developed in this project, which is a potent step in the direction of adaption of “Methanol Economy” in the country.\nThe experiments were conducted on Royal Enfield classic 500cc motorcycle engine, and the open ECU replaced the stock ECU of the motorcycle along with methanol compatible fuel injection equipment. • The use of open ECU allowed the control over various fuel injection parameters of the engine such as injection time, injection duration, spark advance, etc., which control the engine performance and emission. Base fuel maps were created for the open ECU using the combustion data and the stock ECU by reverse engineering. New fuel maps for M85 were created using these base maps as a reference and maximizing the torque for M85 fueling at different engine load-speed combination. The fuel maps were fine-tuned by minimizing the emissions.\nDemonstration of a methanol-fueled motorcycle has opened up a whole new sector of the Indian automobile industry to reduce high dependence on conventional fossil fuels. Moreover, this technology requires manageable modifications in existing engine hardware and software. Royal Enfield (Eicher Motors) and Hero MotoCorp are the industrial partners for this project, and hopefully, the prototype will be further developed by these companies for commercial implementation.\n","date":1500091200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1500091200,"objectID":"f55dba44858a5d013e4a22c330f9371c","permalink":"https://sansitpatnaik.github.io/projects/development-of-500cc-methanol-fueled-motorcycle/","publishdate":"2017-07-15T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/projects/development-of-500cc-methanol-fueled-motorcycle/","section":"projects","summary":"Engine Research Laboratory","tags":[],"title":"Development of 500cc methanol fueled motorcycle","type":"projects"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Hindustan Unilever Limited\nMay 2017 - July 2017\nI completed my summer internship at Pondy Tea Factory, Puducherry under the mentorship of Mr. B N Gohokar.

Previous work can be computationally intensive and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and implemented on a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We present a practical and efficient framework for mobile devices (such as smart phones and robots) where high-level semantic soft biometrics are extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target.

From the query image, the person is detected, clothing is segmented, and clothing features are extracted and quantized. The information is sent from the phone client to a server, where the feature vector of the query image is used to retrieve similar clothing products from online databases. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location.
