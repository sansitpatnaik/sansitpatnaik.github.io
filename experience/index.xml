May 2016 - July 2016
I completed my summer internship at Personal Care Products Division, Himanchal Pradesh of ITC Ltd. under the mentorship of Mr. Vijay Prasad. My project aimed at reduction of manual intervention in soap carton loading on soap packaging line. The soap packaging machine was ACMA 550 that packages 550 Soaps/min. I designed a machine that brought down the operator involvement from 270 minutes to 30 minutes in an 8-hour shift (88% reduction).</description>
